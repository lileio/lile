Lile is a app generator and utility library to help you build [gRPC](http://grpc.io) based services easily in Go with other languages hopefully coming soon. 

The Lile generator creates a ready to go service with features like a working test suite, Dockerfile, Makefile and a cmd line based app amongst others.

The utility library extends the basic gRPC server with nice defaults like metrics, tracing and logging.

A service built with Lile can easily remove Lile as a dependency as Lile is NOT a framework, just a set of helpers.

More documentation will follow once the modular refactor is completed!
