# Pub Sub Spec

Pub Sub in Lile is a seperate library that can be used to augment an existing service to add asynchronous notifications which other services can listen to and act upon.

Each service should receive a message "at least once", meaning that if 6 copies of the `account_service` and 2 copies of the `audit_log_service` are running concurrently then one of each of these services should act upon a message that's been published, i.e one of the `account_service` nodes and one of the `audit_log_service` nodes. This can be thought of as "at least once per service".

In practise this works similarly to [Rabbit MQ's Pub Sub](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-go.html) and [Google's Pub Sub](https://cloud.google.com/go/getting-started/using-pub-sub). Effectively each logical subscriber group has it's own queue which can pull messages and messages are distributed to all queues available.

If a particular service is not interested in messages from a certain service they can simply ignore those messages.
